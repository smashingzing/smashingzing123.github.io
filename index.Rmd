I love telling stories with data and using data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. I am currently a graduate student in biostatistics and data science at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Science. Previously, I worked for one year as a data analyst at Shandong Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the Department of Chronic Disease. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a BA in statistics in 2016.
